# android-ui-bg-tasks
AsyncTask/Fragment base helpers for Android.

As this project is heavily based on AsyncTask, please consider other
alternatives if you target API level 30+.

This class was deprecated in API level 30.
Use the standard java.util.concurrent or Kotlin concurrency utilities instead.
